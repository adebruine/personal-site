<h1>hello world</h1>

<p>Hello! Thanks for visiting. I'm Audrey (she/her/hers), a front-end developer and data storyteller based in the Bay Area. Previously, I did design, development and data viz for projects at the San Francisco Chronicle.

I received my bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in 2019 where I double majored in journalism and statistics. I practiced reporting, researching, and story telling while learning the fundamentals of statistical methods, data analysis and visualization.
